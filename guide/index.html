        <h2>Click jacker tool guide </h2>

        <p>In this article we will discuss -
          <li><a class="glink" href="#usage">
              How to use clickjacker.live to test websites?
          </a></li>

              Testing WordPress websites
          </a></li>
          <li><a class="glink" href="#local-websites">

          </a></li>
  </p>

  <h2 id="usage">How to use this tool?</h2>

  <p> 
      Our tool is designed to scan and analyze multiple websites and web applications for clickjacking vulnerabilities that may compromise the security and user trust of the platform. 
    <br> <br>
    To use our tool to test websites for clickjacking vulnerabilities you will need to provide the website's URL, on which we are going to perform tests, it's recommended to give the exact URL of the page, to get exact results.
    <br> <br>
    When you have the exact URL of the page you want to test, it's finally time to test the page.
    <br> <br>
    To test the page, follow these 3 simple steps:
    <br> <br>
    Step 1 - Go to <a class="glink" href="../">Clickjacker.live</a>. <br>
    Step 2 - Put your URL in the input box. <br>
    Step 3 - Hit enter or press the button that says "check !".
    <br> <br>
    Now its time to observe if the page you provided loads in the "iFrame" below or not, you'll also be provided with extra minor information like "IP address" or "X-frame testing" and so on but the main thing is to observe if you're provided URL loads inside the iFrame or not if it doesn't load in the iFrame below its safe from clickjacking attacks but if it does then it's vulnerable to clickjacking attacks and you need to pay attention to it.

  <h2 id="WordPress-websites">Testing WordPress websites</h2>
  <p>As I mentioned earlier our tool is specialized in testing any type of website and web applications for clickjacking vulnerabilities and it includes WordPress websites as well, you can feel free to use our tool to test any WordPress websites or any other web content management system (WCMS).
    <br> <br>
    Testing WordPress or any other web content management system (WCMS) websites is not different from testing any other plain HTML website, you'll follow the same steps to test a WordPress website which you take to test a normal HTML website. 
  </p>
  <br> <br>
  <h2 id="local-websites">Testing local-host websites</h2>
  <p>
    Testing a website that isn't yet live may seem like an unusual task, but our skilled developers have found a way to do that. By testing local-host websites, we can identify potential vulnerabilities before the site goes live, allowing us to take action on any issue before it becomes a problem.
    <br> <br>
This feature is mostly popular among web developers and content writers who use services like WordPress or other web content management systems (WCMS). With this feature, they can now thoroughly check their websites for any security flaws, ensuring that their content is safe and secure for their users.
<br> <br>
You can test any localhost the same way you test any other website, with the website's localhost, which is usually "http://127.0.0.1:5500".
